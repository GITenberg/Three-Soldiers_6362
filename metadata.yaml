description: 'One of the most grimly honest portraits of World War I. Three Soldiers
  portrays the lives of a trio of army privates: Fuselli, an Italian American store
  clerk from San Francisco; Chrisfield, a farm boy from Indiana; and Andrews, a musically
  gifted Harvard graduate from New York. Hailed as a masterpiece on its original publication
  in 1921, Three Soldiers is a gripping exploration of fear and ambition, conformity
  and rebellion, desertion and violence, and the brutal and dehumanizing effects of
  a regimented war machine on ordinary soldiers. -Amazon.com.'
